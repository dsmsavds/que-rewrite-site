				<h3>Posready</h3>
				<p>The bot is good, but it has its pros and cons, including stolen code (I hope I'm wrong)..<br>Some of the advantages<br>- Antinuke. In this bot from MSav, anti-nukes are getting better and better, and even different from other projects (for example, K-Protect)<br>- Quick setup. Since there are users who do not understand what is what, this bot has a quick setup (just q!antibot on), I think this is a plus<br>In general, as a bot developer since the time of mammoths, the bot is good, and I wish the author good luck in developing the bot and profit to improve its functionality.<br><br></p>

				<h3>Kreosan</h3>
				<p>Bot is good<br>There are some disadvantages and partially stolen, but if you think deeper the source code is not the picture and programmers steal from each other and then you never know who originally wrote the code and what part<br>But the functionality of the bot is good and there is room for improvement, while the creator should be smarter, and not just randomly throw the data from the bot, as I did in my time with ProtectX<br>Good luck in development at least it's not garbage from K-Protect that I was forced to fix and verify.<br><br><br><br></p>
